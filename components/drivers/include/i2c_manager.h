  According to the doc of ESP-IDF, the default value of this time_out is 100ms.
  However, for some devices, for example the bmi270 gyro, we need to burst write a
  config file with length 8192 bytes, which takes about 185ms for a I2C bus with
  clock frequency 400kHz, this will cause seriout problem. So we recommend to set
  this time_out value up to at least 400ms, this won't influence performance.
